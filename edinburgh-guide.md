### Kebab Mehal

Could definitely be my favourite curry on earth. Seems like a grotty little kebab place but
is actually one of Edinburgh's most respected Pakistani restaurants. Don't get a kebab. Don't get
a pizza. The Chicken Tikka Masalla is a unique highlight and the Naan's are about the size of a small
child. Biryani's are a big favourite here also.
